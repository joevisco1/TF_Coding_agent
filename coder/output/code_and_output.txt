To execute the Terraform code:

1. Save the code in a file named `main.tf`.
2. Run the following commands in your terminal:
   - Initialize the Terraform working directory: 
     ```
     terraform init
     ```
   - Preview the changes that will be applied:
     ```
     terraform plan
     ```
   - Apply the changes to create the S3 buckets:
     ```
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Confirm the action by typing "yes" when prompted.
  
After running the apply command, Terraform will create two S3 buckets named `jv1` and `jv2`, and you will see the output showing the names of the created buckets.
